The Singapore Judicial Service offers internships to students studying for a recognised law degree [as stipulated under the Legal Profession (Qualified Persons) Rules].

All applicants would need to complete an "Internship Application Form" (please click [here](https://go.gov.sg/sjsinternships2026) for the said form).  All applicants are requested to kindly review the “Guidance Notes” (set out in the said form) before completing and submitting an application. 

All interns are eligible for a "monthly allowance" at the prevailing rate prescribed by the Public Service Division. The quantum of the said monthly “internship allowance” will be pro-rated (where applicable) – based on the number of actual working hours in the month that the intern undertook the internship. 

All queries may be directed to the Internship Manager of the Singapore Judicial Service at [jsc_sec@jsc.gov.sg](mailto:jsc_sec@jsc.gov.sg).

**CANDIDATES WITH 5 YEARS' OR LESS EXPERIENCE**

Candidates with five years or less of strong relevant legal work experience (and who fully satisfy the requirements/criteria specified under the section “Eligibility for Appointment as a JSO”) may apply to be considered for possible shortlisting for an interview for appointment as a JSO.

The candidates who are selected for appointment as a JSO will be subject to a three-contract framework totalling four years. The said candidates will be appointed on three consecutive contracts comprising two contracts of 18 months each and one contract of 12 months prior to being considered for possible emplacement on the permanent establishment after four years.

These candidates may, at the discretion of the Judicial Service, have their prior strong relevant legal work experience recognised and be eligible for the award of additional increments and/or appointment at a higher JSO-grade.

These JSOs may, on their successful completion of the initial contract, strong work performance and fully satisfying the requisite eligibility criteria, be considered for the possible offer of subsequent contracts and thereafter possible emplacement on the permanent establishment.

The possible emplacement on the permanent establishment of these JSOs will continue to be subject to the quality of the officer’s work, demonstrated potential and strong work performance during the period of the contracts and the needs of the Judicial Service.

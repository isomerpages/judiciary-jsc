(and who fully satisfy the requirements/criteria specified under the section
“Eligibility for Appointment as a JSO”) may apply to be considered for
possible shortlisting for an interview for appointment as a JSO.</p>
<p>The candidates who are selected for appointment as a JSO will be subject
to a three-contract framework totalling four years. The said candidates
will be appointed on three consecutive contracts comprising two contracts
of 18 months each and one contract of 12 months prior to being considered
for possible emplacement on the permanent establishment after four years.</p>
<p>These candidates may, at the discretion of the Judicial Service, have
their prior strong relevant legal work experience recognised and be eligible
for the award of additional increments and/or appointment at a higher JSO-grade.</p>
<p>These JSOs may, on their successful completion of the initial contract,
continued strong work performance and fully satisfying the requisite eligibility
criteria, be considered for the possible offer of subsequent contracts
and thereafter possible emplacement on the permanent establishment.</p>
<p>The possible emplacement on the permanent establishment of these JSOs
will continue to be subject to the quality of the officer’s work, demonstrated
competencies and strong work performance during the period of the contracts
and the needs of the Judicial Service.</p>

Undergraduates studying for an LLB programme at the NUS, the SMU or the SUSS or an LLB/B.A. Law/B.A. (Hons) Juris programme at a Scheduled University, and candidates studying for a JD programme at the the NUS, the SMU, the SUSS or a Scheduled University, and who have successfully completed at least their second year of study, may apply to be considered for possible shortlisting for an  interview for the possible offer of “conditional” appointment as a JSO.

The possible confirmation of the offer of the “conditional” appointment as a JSO will be reviewed on the candidate’s full/successful completion of the LLB/B.A. Law/B.A. (Hons) Juris/JD programme and being awarded the requisite qualification. 

The candidates whose offer of “conditional” appointment as a JSO is confirmed will be subject to a three-contract framework totalling four years. The said candidates will be appointed on three consecutive contracts comprising two contracts of 18 months each and one contract of 12 months prior to being considered for possible emplacement on the permanent establishment after four years.

These JSOs may, on their successful completion of the initial contract, strong work performance and fully satisfying the requisite eligibility criteria, be considered for the possible award of subsequent contracts and thereafter emplacement on the permanent establishment.

The possible emplacement on the permanent establishment of these JSOs will continue to be subject to the quality of the officer’s work, demonstrated potential and strong work performance during the period of the contracts and the needs of the Judicial Service.

The Judiciary is one of the three Organs of State. The Honourable the Chief Justice heads the Singapore Judiciary. Within the Judicial Service, the Registrar of the Supreme Court supervises the Judicial Service Officers (“JSOs”) in the Supreme Court; while the Presiding Judge of the Family Justice Courts and the Presiding Judge of the State Courts lead the Judicial Service Officers in the Family Justice Courts and the State Courts, respectively. The Registrar of the Supreme Court, the Presiding Judge of the Family Justice Courts and the Presiding Judge of the State Courts are accountable to The Honourable the Chief Justice for their management of these JSOs.

The JSOs in the Singapore Judicial Service play a vital role in administering justice and upholding the rule of law in our country. JSOs appointed to the Judicial Service may serve at the Supreme Court, the Family Justice Courts or the State Courts.
